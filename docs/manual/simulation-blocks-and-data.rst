The `previous
chapter <reading-setup-files.html>`__
introduced the basic concepts of reading data from the configuration
file. This chapter covers how the configuration file can be used to
create a hierarchical structure of simulation blocks. In this way the
simulation code can allow the end user to switch different parts of the
simulation on or off, or to exchange one numerical algorithm for
another. It also provides a mechanism for customising the simulation
output in a very flexible way. This section contains the following
topics.
