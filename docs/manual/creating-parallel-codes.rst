Schnek provides a simplified interface for creating parallel simulation
codes. At the heart of this interface lies theÂ \ ``DomainSubdivision``
class. This class defines an abstract interface for partitioning a
global simulation domain into local sub-domains for the individual
processes. Implementations of this interface use MPI routines to pass
data between the processes. This section covers the following topics.
